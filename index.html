        <h2 class="section-title">Personal Profile</h2>
    </summary>
    <p>A globally minded student whose curiosity bridges data, science, and technology.</p>
    <p>My early cross-cultural experiences nurtured adaptability and open thinking, while my growing interest in data analysis and automation has connected my love of logic, systems, and creativity.</p>
    <p>I aspire to study Electrical and Electronic Engineering—not only to understand how circuits and signals shape the modern world, but also to explore how intelligent systems can make life more connected and meaningful.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Global Experiences & Curiosity for Discovery</h2>
    </summary>
    <p>In Grade 3, I accompanied my father—then a visiting scholar at the University of Wollongong—and studied Year 4 at Keiraville Public School in Australia.</p>
    <p>That experience opened my eyes to how people, ideas, and systems connect across cultures. It inspired a lasting curiosity about how the world works—from communication to technology—and a genuine appreciation for discovery.</p>
    <p>Outside the classroom, I enjoyed tennis, football, cross-country, swimming, and surfing. Surfing and swimming especially taught me focus, persistence, and balance—qualities that continue to guide both my studies and my life.</p>

      <summary>Academic Growth Across Three Countries (Click to Expand)</summary>
      <div class="detail-content">
        <p>Mathematics and programming have always been my strengths. In Australia, I was often drawn to exploring how logic could solve 
          real problems. In China, I developed strong performance in English and Chinese, ranking 10th out of 500 students. After moving 
          to Canada, I adapted quickly to a new academic environment, maintaining an average of 94% in Grade 11 while taking
           AP Physics 2 (4), as well as achieving an IELTS score of 8.5 overall (Listening and Reading: 9.0). 
           Beyond school, I attended summer programs and continued self-learning in data and computing. I am working on another two AP courses now.</p>

      <summary>Gene Data Analysis Project – Exploring Data Systems and Signal Processing (Click to Expand)</summary>
      <div class="detail-content">
        <p>Driven by curiosity, I initiated a project to analyze gene-related datasets. It introduced me to a fascinating collection of data acquisition and analysis technologies. By developing automated data-processing workflows, I explored how data collection, signal acquisition, and information processing systems interact. Guided by my curiosity, these experiences deepened my engagement with electronics, signals, and automation, leaving me eager to explore the possibilities of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in the future.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Athletics & Endurance</h2>
    </summary>
    <p>I have loved water since I was two years old. Playing in swimming pools gave me endless joy and gradually built both skill and confidence. In kindergarten, I was selected by Coach Wu Ying, a championship coach from Chen Jinglun Youth Swimming Team, and began six years of semi-professional training. Although I chose not to pursue competitive swimming as a career, the discipline and endurance I developed have shaped my approach to learning and life.</p>
    <p>In Australia, I swam in the ocean almost every day—one session for swimming, another for surfing. I received multiple awards at school swimming carnivals and was invited to the Illawarra Regional Championships, though I fell ill just before the competition. After returning to China, I joined the school basketball and orienteering teams, earning medals in track and field events. Now in Canada, I play badminton nearly every day and continue swimming weekly. Sports have brought me health, friendships, and the joy of teamwork—values that carry into all areas of my life.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Music, Reflection, and Creativity</h2>
    </summary>
    <p>Music has always been more than a practice—it has been a source of calm, reflection, and happiness. Learning the violin taught me patience, focus, and the beauty of detail. Even though I paused formal training, I hope to return to it in the future. Music continues to inspire how I think, imagine, and create—both in art and in engineering.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Future Aspirations</h2>
    </summary>
    <p>I look forward to studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering, exploring how circuits, signals, and intelligent systems can improve lives. From data systems to automation and applied computing, I hope to design technologies that make the world more connected, efficient, and human. What began as curiosity has become a direction—a path where creativity and engineering meet.</p>
